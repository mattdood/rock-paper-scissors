Rock paper scissors in Java, against a computer

The button in the HTML doc allows the user to play five rounds against the computer. Selections are used against the computer's randomized moves, with results displayed in console.

Instructions are included below, notated by comment dashes ( // )

// //Game functions defined:
// Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.
// We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.
//
// Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors.
// The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection
//
// Then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
// make your function case insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation)
//
// Important note: you want to return the results of this function call, not console.log() them.
//
// Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
// At this point you should still just be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.
//
// Use prompt() to get input from the user.
